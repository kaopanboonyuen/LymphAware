LymphAware introduces a principled framework for disentangling true lymphoma morphology from acquisition-driven shortcut artifacts in histopathology AI. The architecture decomposes representation learning into three explicitly structured pathways: (1) a morphology-isolating encoder that captures biologically meaningful nuclear architecture and tissue organization; (2) a shortcut–perturbation mechanism that simulates stain, scanner, and background variability to expose artifact-sensitive features; and (3) a cross-domain alignment objective that enforces stability of diagnostic representations under controlled acquisition shifts.

By converting hidden shortcut dependencies into observable perturbation responses, LymphAware transforms domain shift from a post hoc failure into a train-time supervisory signal. This structured bias disruption yields acquisition-invariant yet morphology-preserving embeddings, improving robustness in heterogeneous multi-source settings without requiring verified institutional labels.

The resulting model demonstrates stable high-threshold sensitivity, graceful degradation under loss-weight variation, and attribution patterns aligned with pathology-relevant regions. LymphAware reframes domain generalization as representation-level shortcut decomposition, advancing reliable and clinically meaningful lymphoma diagnosis.
